        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology ðŸ§ </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently an undergraduate student at UC Riverside pursuing a B.A. in Pyschology. The brain and behavior has always fascinated me and is something that I would like to learn more about and study. The neuroscience field is also something that I am very interested in. I plan on working either in the medical field or doing research. Currently I am learning computer programming and coding. Although I'm not an expert programmer, (yet!) I enjoy learning (and failing at) it. Constructing things has always been an interest to me and programming has satisfied that for me-- I hope to learn much more. <br><br>
    I have volunteer experience feeding the elderly, homeless, and those in need, in my hometown of Riverside. My family has donated food to multiple families in the area and to those in the homeless shelter in downtown Riverside. In tandem with the local churches, my family hosts feedings for those in need. We serve them hot food and drinks and give them blankets, sleeping bags, and dog food (if needed). Growing up in Riverside, I saw many homeless people and gave them money when I had some but I had never had an actual conversation with them. Volunteering changed that completely and I'm glad it did. <br><br>
        
        I am very passionate about animals, equality, and activism. Using my voice to fight for the voiceless and the ignored is very important to me. Growing up, I have always been an animal lover but it was not until recently that I saw the atrocities of the meat and dairy industry and started living a vegan lifestyle. I have 4 pets: two cats & two dogs. My two cats, Luna and Prada, are both rescues from the animal shelter. They were both kittens when we rescued them. Luna was born in the shelter while Prada was rescued from the streets. The two have very contrasting personalities but they enjoy each other's company--They sometimes cuddle and groom each other, but play-fight very often. My two dogs are named Zoey and Boo-Boo. Zoey also was a rescue while Boo-Boo was a stray dog and we never found his owners after putting signs all over the neighborhood. My hobbies include electric skateboarding, cooking, gardening, and discovering new music. Recently I have gotten into growing my own vegetables at home but I have yet to have success. As for electric skateboarding, I have a Boosted Board and it has been such a ride. Riding my skateboard around is very calming yet exhilarating--sometimes I ride around with music in my ears to de-stress and relax. Listening to new music and podcasts is something I strive to do everyday. Allowing myself to discover new music has allowed me to expand my horizons and tastes. Before, I was fixated on only a few genres of music and now I try to listen to the different genres and artists. Broadening my tastes has allowed me to find great music that I wouldnâ€™t have before.    <br><br>
